# Data-Science-Projects
This repository contains various Data Science projects I have built and worked on thus far using Python.
This Projects span from beginner level and advancing slowly.
Using various python packages and libarary such as Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Pyplots and cufflinks.
I have been able to visualize data and also build several models which serve to predict several future outcomes and events.
